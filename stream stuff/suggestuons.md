* Its good but more colar insted of gray. - @[Do-Not-Dusturb](https://github.com/Do-Not-Dusturb)
* the old one was cooler with the background and the how long you've been here and the panik button - added both of thoes
* I prefer the old layout it was more fun, also it kinda hard to find the games. - yeah... the search thing is a little bit buggy
* idk i just like this format its more fun and the new one feels kinda blank but idk i dont hate it - so like a 6ish/10? i understand but yeah idk
* Not enough games - duh
* new site - "cause it looks weird" - i have no clue but ok i guess
* it sucks because the old one is better - ok?
